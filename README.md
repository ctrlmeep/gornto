# gornto

**A personal code-repository of school assignments and learning projects**  

This repository contains my school assignments plus various mini-projects and experiments written in Python and Kotlin. It serves as a learning journal for me — and a resource for classmates or others who want to learn from my code.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `assignments/` — Completed school assignments (mostly Python scripts or Kotlin projects).  
- `learningKotlin/` — Personal experiments, practice projects, and learning exercises in Kotlin.
